      The one thing I've learned over the past couple years is that time waits
      for no one. With uncertainty around every corner, there are no guarantees
      about what tomorrow brings. That's why the time is now to go after what
      sets your soul on fire. If you have a business idea that keeps you up at
      night, start working on your plan today. If your heart is telling you to
      finally write that novel, set a word count goal and get typing. If you
      dream about moving countries or taking a year off to travel the world,
      start scrimping and saving your pennies. Life is short and unpredictable.
    </p>
    Don't keep pushing your dreams off until “someday.” Someday may never
    arrive. Make the conscious decision to start manifesting your goals <em>TODAY.</em>
    The momentum will pick up faster than you imagine. Inspiration will strike
    when you commit to taking daily action. Doors will fly open just when you
    need them to. But you have to start now. Now, I'm not saying you should
    throw all caution to the wind. Do your homework, understand the risks, and
    prepare yourself before jumping in headfirst. 
    But don't get stuck
    overanalyzing and researching for months on end either. At a certain point,
    you have to take the leap and fully commit to your dreams. Curate that
    Instagram account showcasing your art/poetry/crafts. Book that ticket to the
    wilderness retreat to finish your screenplay. Say yes to coaching that youth
    sports team you've always wanted to volunteer with. <strong>Stop waiting for the
    perfect time. It will never arrive. The perfect time is today.</strong>
    <p>
      I can't predict where all this will lead, but I'm excited to find out. If
      you feel a passionate pull toward something bigger than your current
      reality, listen to it. Let it move you into courageous action today. Your
      future self will thank you. Now...what big dreams are YOU ready to start
      chasing today?
